ðŸ§  1. Wait for Training Completion

The algorithm must finish its training phase (usually 24â€“48 hours).

During this time, it learns patterns from historical data and impressions to predict value scores.


âœ… Tip: Ensure your training data has enough volume (impressions/conversions) for better model performance.

ðŸ“Œ 2. Assign the Custom Bidding Algorithm

Once training is complete:

Go to Insertion Orders (IOs) or Line Items in DV360.

Select the Bidding Strategy section.

Choose Custom Bidding and pick your trained algorithm from the list.

Set any required floor CPM or bid caps as per your campaign strategy.


ðŸ‘‰ This ensures your campaigns start bidding using your custom logic rather than standard automated strategies.


---

ðŸ§ª 3. (Optional but Recommended) Set Up an Experiment

Create an A/B experiment to compare performance:

Group A: Uses the custom bidding algorithm.

Group B: Uses your current standard bidding.


Define success metrics (e.g., CPA, ROAS, conversions, viewability, attention score, etc.).

Run the experiment for at least 2â€“4 weeks to get statistically meaningful results.


âœ… Why it matters: Helps validate the performance of your algorithm before scaling.

ðŸ“Š 4. Monitor Performance Closely

Use the Bidding Overview and Custom Bidding Scorecard.

Track:

Impressions won

Conversion lift

eCPM and CPA changes

Any anomalies or under-delivery.

ðŸ“š 5. Optimize if Needed

If performance is below expectations:

Check signal weightings or features in the script.

Add more historical data.

Retrain or adjust model parameters.
