On a vast battlefield under a blood-red sky, arrows rain down like fire. In the foreground on the left side, Lord Rama stands firm on a rocky mound, facing right. His body is steady, feet apart, bow drawn back with a glowing divine arrow. A bolt of lightning flashes behind him, illuminating his calm but fierce expression.

In the far right background, King Ravana stands tall, facing left, directly opposite Rama. His armored body gleams, his ten heads roar in fury, full beard and demonic face clear. His golden chariot lies shattered behind him in flames, smoke curling into the sky.

Rama releases the arrow in slow motion — the divine shaft glows gold, cutting across the battlefield from left to right, leaving a trail of light that pierces the darkness. The arrow strikes Ravana in the chest; his massive body jerks back, his weapons fall, his heads scream and fade. Ravana stumbles backwards into an empty, dark background, collapsing like a fallen giant, symbolizing the end of evil.

The camera holds steady on Rama in the left foreground — standing tall, lowering his bow with dignity, divine aura radiating around him. Behind Rama, Lakshmana, Hanuman, and the vanara army erupt in a victorious roar, weapons raised to the sky. Conch shells and temple bells echo as the scene ends with Rama standing unshaken, Ravana lying fallen in the distance
