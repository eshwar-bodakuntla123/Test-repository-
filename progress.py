“On a grand battlefield beneath a glowing red sky, arrows streak across the air like fire. In the foreground to the left, Lord Rama stands tall on a rocky mound, facing right. His bow is drawn with a radiant divine arrow, lightning illuminating his calm but resolute face.

On the right side, mighty Ravana stands opposite, armored, his many heads roaring in defiance. Behind him, his golden chariot glimmers in broken fragments, flames flickering in the distance.

Rama releases the divine arrow in slow motion — the glowing light travels across the battlefield, filling the scene with brilliance. As it reaches Ravana, the screen floods with golden light, and Ravana’s form begins to fade into the brightness, symbolizing the fall of darkness.

The light clears, and Rama remains standing firm in the left foreground, lowering his bow with dignity. Behind him, Lakshmana, Hanuman, and the vanara army lift their weapons high, cheering in victory. The camera pulls back to reveal Rama glowing with divine aura, Ravana’s shadow dissolving in the distance, while conch shells and temple bells echo.
