Wide shot of a dark, stormy battlefield, lightning flickers across the sky. Rāvaṇa stands atop a jagged rock, ten heads towering menacingly, each showing a different expression of rage, cunning, and determination. His massive, muscular frame is clad in ornate golden armor, blackened in places from battle. Winds howl around him, his flowing cape and hair snapping violently, emphasizing his raw, commanding presence. Close-up: one of his eyes narrows, plotting the next strike; his hands grip a colossal, intricately carved mace, veins bulging, fingers trembling with restrained fury. Sparks and embers swirl around him as fires from the battlefield reflect across his multiple faces, giving him a fearsome, almost otherworldly aura. Slow-motion shot: Rāvaṇa raises his mace, lightning illuminating his form, ready to crush all who oppose him. The camera pans around, showing his imposing stature against the chaos of the battlefield, portraying him as both terrifying and regal — the ultimate force of power and intellect, radiating dominance and unyielding resolve.
