“Aerial sweeping shot over the battlefield, slowly rotating to capture Lord Rama on the left and Rāvaṇa on the right, both facing each other, standing firmly in heroic poses. Rama’s bow is still drawn, arrow glowing faintly, his posture calm yet powerful, eyes unwavering, radiating focus and courage. Rāvaṇa stands tall on jagged rock, ten heads showing different expressions—rage, determination, and cunning—as he braces defensively, massive golden mace held ready.

The battlefield around them is shrouded in swirling dust and mist, with embers from distant fires drifting through the air. Lightning briefly illuminates the sky, casting dramatic shadows and highlighting the intricate details of Rāvaṇa’s armor and Rama’s golden bow.

Cinematic camera effect: Slow aerial zoom-in circling the characters, emphasizing their heroic scale and the tension of the moment. The camera captures the contrast between Rama’s composed determination and Rāvaṇa’s imposing power, while the swirling mist, sparks, and environmental motion add grandeur and cinematic depth.

Both characters’ heroic postures, showing anticipation and power.

Environmental effects: dust, mist, embers, and lightning.

Dramatic lighting emphasizing textures and facial expressions.

Safe, epic cinematic tension, no graphic violence, just anticipation of the legendary clash.”
