“On a vast mythical stage beneath a glowing red-golden sky, Lord Rama stands on the left side, radiant, holding a shining bow of light. His calm face glows with determination as a divine arrow made of pure energy forms in his hands.

On the right side, majestic Ravana appears, towering with his many heads, his form shimmering with shadows. His broken golden chariot glimmers behind him, surrounded by flickering firelight.

Rama releases the arrow of light — it travels across the sky, transforming the battlefield into brilliance. Ravana’s figure slowly dissolves into the golden radiance, as if darkness itself is melting away.

The light clears to reveal Rama glowing with a divine aura, standing strong as Hanuman, Lakshmana, and the vanara army cheer joyfully behind him. The scene ends with the sky filled with lamps and fireworks, symbolizing the triumph of light over darkness.”
